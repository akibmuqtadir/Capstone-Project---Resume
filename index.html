    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I’m currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Finance and Banking at Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP). I have a strong interest in data science, sustainability, and global issues, which is why I’m set to continue my academic journey at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University (APU), Japan, under the College of Sustainability and Tourism with a focus on Data Science.
        <p>My academic and extracurricular experiences reflect a deep curiosity and versatility. I’ve participated in a national Supply Chain Research Competition, worked as an eco-census data collector, and contributed to events like the BD IQ Olympiad. At Dhaka College, I was also an active member of the Science and Cultural Club.</p>
        <p>Beyond academics, I enjoy gaming, watching movies, and self-studying tech topics. I’m currently exploring research opportunities that combine environmental science and data-driven solutions. With a goal to develop practical skills in AI and analytics, I aim to contribute to sustainable, data-informed innovations for the future.</p>
